# MeshCentral Material UI

Custom UI for MeshCentral based on Material UI

The meshcentral-web folder, along with its custom files, must be placed in the root folder of your MeshCentral instance (where meshcentral-data and meshcentral-files).

# Notes (unclear instruction from main branch, will be looked into)

Requires MeshCentral to be configured with the following options: (maybe not nightMode, but it was designed with that configured)

```
"domains": {
  "": {
    "hide": 5,
    "nightMode": 1,
    "minify": false
  }
},
```
